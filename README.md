# face-detection
This is a real-time face detection project. It works with Haar CasCade algorithm which uses black and whiter filters for detecting faces in a video or in live webcam.
Implementing this into code is surprisingly easy using OpenCV’s CascadeClassifier function.
This project has two files, a main python script for code and another named "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml" that is used for training the algorithm.

###  What Is Haar CasCade Algorithm?
A Haar classifier, or a Haar cascade classifier, is a machine learning object detection program that identifies objects in an image and video.
The algorithm can be explained in four stages:

1-Calculating Haar Features

2-Creating Integral Images

3-Using Adaboost

4-Implementing Cascading Classifiers

It’s important to remember that this algorithm requires a lot of positive images of faces and negative images of non-faces to train the classifier, similar to other machine learning models.
